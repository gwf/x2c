## Implementation tracks

### A. Readable scalar ledger and layouts

Gary's review of `db86d4b7`:

- `lib/native-scalar-types.xmacro` builds about 130 lines of x2c syntax by
  hand in Lisp. Replace that with an x2c-bodied template, as in
  `$var.tag.unbox` (`lib/var-tags.xmacro`), and turn the chain of
  `List.equal` tests in `native_scalar_access` into a lookup built once from
  the rows. First check whether the row list can drive the template
  directly; if not, list the 14 invocations as `lib/common.x` does.
- Layouts have the fixed shape `(KIND TYPE SIZE ALIGN ...)`. Replace
  one-at-a-time indexing (`layout[2]`, `layout[4]`, `row[3]`) with
  destructuring and `match` in `src/compiler.x` `_meta_type_layout`,
  `src/comptime.x` (`_lower_field_offset`, `_lower_pointer_tag`,
  `_lower_new_object`), and `lib/lisp.x` (`lisp_peek`, `lisp_poke`).
- Split `_meta_type_layout` into one helper per kind (var, scalar, pointer,
  record) and a short dispatcher.

No behavior change; the fixtures and unit suites are the check.

### B. Numeric Func argument cost

`x2c_func_value_argument` (`lib/func.x`) wraps every numeric conversion in a
five-clause `try`/`catch` and prepares those catch plans on every call. It
made compile-time field access 7x slower until the byte operations took
their offsets as `Var`. Every other numeric native call from compile-time
code still pays it. Make the conversion prepare its catch plans once, or
avoid the catch on the common success path; then consider returning the byte
operations in `lib/lisp.x` to `long` offsets. Measure with a
200,000-iteration `$` loop before and after.

### C. Smaller defects from the final review

Each should decline with a plain reason or work as C does:

- `p[0]` on a real pointer lowers to `Array_getindex` and fails at evaluation.
- `NULL` in a meta body reports `file-scope state not declared meta`.
- `foreach (int x, ...)` with a typed non-Var output is refused with
  `unsupported expression`.
- `bool` and enum struct fields have no layout; `bool *` addresses fail.
- `lib/clibc.x` declares `strncmp` with `unsigned long`, which is not
  `size_t` on the LLP64 MSYS2 route. A signature change needs two bootstrap
  rounds, because the running compiler's target must match.
- The Symbol pairing is a named special case in `_meta_type_layout`,
  `lisp_peek` and `lisp_poke`; a generic retag by the layout's TAG would
  remove it.

### D. `--system-headers` cost and packing

`--system-headers` reads every expanded system header, about 3x slower than
`--cpp-symbols` on a small file, and masks `_Atomic(T)` with a `-D`. Structs
under `#pragma pack` are not detected and get natural alignment. Consider
restricting expansion to headers the source includes directly, and detecting
packing so such structs have no compile-time layout.

Outcome, 2026-09-22:

- Cost. `builds/0/x2c translate`, best of 3 over 5 runs on an M4 Max,
  default / `--cpp-symbols` / `--system-headers`: a trivial `main`
  0.03 / 0.08 / 0.05 s; `meta-system-header-record.x` 0.06 / 0.15 / 0.11 s;
  a file including `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `string.h`, `time.h` and
  `pthread.h` 0.03 / 0.08 / 0.08 s. `--system-headers` is not slower than
  `--cpp-symbols`, so the 3x premise does not reproduce. Expansion stays
  unrestricted: restricting it to direct includes would lose
  `struct timespec`, which macOS declares in `sys/_types/_timespec.h`
  through `_time.h` and glibc in `bits/types/struct_timespec.h`.
- Packing. Tokenizing records where `#pragma pack` turns packing on or off,
  outside unreachable conditional arms. Each arm of a conditional group
  starts from the state at its opening, and the state after the group joins
  what the reachable arms leave. Tokenizing also marks each `packed`,
  `aligned`, `mode` or `vector_size` attribute. Collection reads a header's
  attributes directly; a preprocessing mode turns each attribute into a
  marked string rather than erasing it, and tokenizing erases the string. A
  struct defined under packing or around such a mark has no compile-time
  layout, and meta code that uses it declines with `a compile-time struct
  with no host layout`.
- Remaining:
  - Default collection reads each file separately, so it misses packing that
    one header starts and another ends (Windows `pshpack1.h` and
    `poppack.h`). `--cpp-symbols` and `--system-headers` read the
    preprocessed unit and decline such a struct. Closing the gap needs each
    collected header's net packing effect carried into its includer's scan,
    including through header caches and `.xi` interfaces.
  - A layout attribute on a typedef, such as
    `typedef long aligned_long __attribute__((aligned(16)))`, and a field
    declared `_Alignas`, leave a struct its natural layout; neither mark
    lies in the struct's own definition.
  - `-D_Atomic(T)=T` stays: `_Atomic` scalars have the size and alignment of
    their plain type on the supported hosts, so a struct with such a field
    keeps a correct layout. An `_Atomic` struct type could differ and is not
    handled.

## Design tracks (decide with Gary first)

### E. Meta-capable protocols

Make protocol conformances the source of compile-time bindings, replacing
hand-listed targets such as the Iter `_into` rows in `lib/lisp.x` and the
`C.iterator` table in `etc/comptime.xlisp`. See
[meta authoring and coverage](meta-authoring-and-coverage.md#meta-capable-protocol-opportunity).

### F. Lifetime certification

Compile-time code follows C semantics, so a pointer to an expired local is
undefined, and nothing checks it. The goal is for compile-time code to
consume the compiler's shared lifetime analysis rather than add its own. The
lifetime-certified tranche of the
[internal adoption campaign](internal-adoption-campaign.md) depends on it.

### G. Native extensions (last stage)

Build a project's native code with generated typed adapters into a loadable
module, then load it for translation, build, or REPL use through the same
binding path as the compiler's linked functions. The command spelling,
registration compatibility, shared runtime state and module lifetime are
open.

## Unblocked elsewhere

The generalized-meta tranche of the
[internal adoption campaign](internal-adoption-campaign.md), starting with
Autodiff, was waiting on this work and can start now.
